  An H-bridge is a simple circuit that lets you control a DC motor to go backward or forward.
  
Changing the polarity of the power supply to DC motor is used to change the direction of rotation.
Apart from changing the rotation direction, the H-bridge can provide additional operation modes, "brake" and "free run until frictional stop". The H-bridge arrangement is generally used to reverse the polarity/direction of the motor, but can also be used to 'brake' the motor, where the motor comes to a sudden stop, as the motor's terminals are shorted

   Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. then wait for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the     time required. 
    calculated based on this formula: Distance = Â½ T x C
    
   T = Time and C = the speed of sound
